# PythonPet
Have your own pet and save their details in a local text file so you can come back to them.

# Instructions
Make sure you have Python 2.7+ installed on your machine. Install the three files (`petmain.py`, `petutil.py`, `petaction.py`) and put them in a directory on your machine.

Windows: Look up how to run Python on windows, then run `petmain.py`. I'll put more instructions here in the future.

MacOS: In your terminal, go to the directory you created containing the PythonPet files and type `python petmain.py`.
